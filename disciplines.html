              Bendigo Target Archery Club offers Target, Indoor, and Clout
              archery. Target, Indoor and Clout competitions are regularly
              hosted on our facilities.

              <h3>Target</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              Target archery involves shooting at a target butt centred
              approximately 1.5m above ground level which will have scoring
              circles of up to 122cm in diameter on the target face. The target
              face has concentric circles and scoring starts in the centre with
              the smallest circle – the bulls eye – recorded as an X which
              equals 10 points. The next larger circle also equals 10, then 9,
              8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and then M for miss. Some target faces only
              have X through to 6 scoring rings. There are also a few smaller
              target faces where the circles are closer together. Archers
              usually shoot 3 or 6 arrows per ‘end’.
            </p>

            <p>
              The club accommodates approximately 50 target lanes or 150 archers
              shooting simultaneously, with target distances up to 90 metres.
            </p>
            <div class="section-title">
              <h3>Indoor</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              Indoor archery has smaller scoring faces than target archery and
              archers shoot 3 arrows per end at 18m or 25m distances. The target
              faces are fixed to a vertical wall centred approximately 1.2m to
              1.7m above the floor. 18m distances use a 40cm diameter with X/10
              through to 1 scoring rings or a ‘three spot’, which shows three
              separate target circles with scoring circles from X/10 to the 6
              ring. The ‘three spot’ requires the archer to shoot one arrow into
              each of the three circles
            </p>
            <p>
              The indoor shed holds 15 18m indoor target lanes. Most of the
              lanes also allow 25m shooting distances. The club uses an
              electronic timing system in the indoor halls.
            </p>
            <div class="section-title">
              <h3>Clout</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              The target face in clout is 15 metres across and is flat on the
              ground! Each scoring circle on the target is about 75cm wide and
              is bordered by a coloured flag identifying the standard 10 ring
              scoring circles. The ‘bulls eye’ in the centre of the target face
              is a marker post which is called the Clout. Archers shoot six
              arrows per end, aiming up into the air to about a 45 degree angle
              so their arrows travel in a large parabola.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clout is shot at distances from 100m to 180m depending on the
              archer’s age and bow division
            </p>
