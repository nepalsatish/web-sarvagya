                <h3>Archery With Disabilities</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                The club supports archers with all abilities, including members
                competing at national and international para-archery events and
                the Invictus Games. Club facilities include indoor shooting
                facilities, paved disabled parking bays, an accessible toilet,
                and cement paths between buildings. The grassed outdoor fields
                are also used by para-archers. Experienced instructors and
                coaches can take you from novice through to international
                competitor and our members provide a friendly, supportive
                environment. You will need to arrange your own carer if
                required. Please contact us to discuss your requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a sport, archery can cater for a range of disabilities and
                visual impairments. Therefore the club wholeheartedly welcomes
                and encourages people with a disability or visual impairment to
                join. All newcomers to BTAC must do our Archery Course before
                being accepted as a club member. Courses are usually held on our
                outdoor field from 7.45 – 11.30am on the first Saturday of each
                month, all equipment inclusive. In the event of inclement
                weather, courses go ahead in the onsite indoor facility. An
                induction session is held from 8:00am – 11:30am on the Saturday
                following for course attendees who would like to join the club.
              </p>
              <p>
                All beginners, including those with a disability or vision
                impairment, undergo the same instruction process on the same
                shooting line. If you require an assistant for your
                participation, your assistant must do the Archery Course with
                you. This is for your safety and also so that the assistant can
                receive instruction on how to become an archery assistant.
              </p>
              <p>
                The club requires advance warning about beginners who have a
                disability or visual impairment. This will allow the club if
                necessary to allocate extra coaching or one-on-one coaching.
                Please be aware that as BTAC is run solely by volunteers and
                volunteer coaches who give freely of their time, our personnel
                resources are finite. This necessarily limits the number of
                disabled and visually impaired archers that we can cater for at
                any one Archery Course.
              </p>
              <p>
                Archers who require an assistant and who decide to join the club
                as members must organise and attend with their own assistant at
                all times. The club cannot undertake to provide assistants.
                Assistants are required to join the club as Associate Members
                (non-shooting members) and can attend the Archery Course free of
                charge. This ensures that the club meets its insurance
                obligations and safety protocols are followed.
              </p>
